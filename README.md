# Malware Analysis Lab

Malware is a significant threat to computer systems, making malware analysis a crucial function of cybersecurity. To better understand malware and protect against it, I am creating a malware analysis lab using VirtualBox, Windows 10, and Flare VM. The purpose of this lab is to analyze malware in a safe and controlled environment. Using these tools, I will be able to identify and dissect malware in-depth, catalog any malicious activity, and formulate effective methods of detection and removal. This documentation outlines my process of creating and using the malware analysis lab, as well as the tools and techniques used.

### GoalsüèÜ
- The main goal of this lab is be to gain practical experience in analyzing different types of malware. I can achieve this by testing and analyzing various malware samples, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and others.
- To understand the behavior of malware, how it works and how to prevent it from causing damage.
- To be able to develop practical and effective techniques for detecting and removing malware.
- Staying up-to-date with the latest malware threats
  
### Tools Usedüî®

- VirtualBox Installer
- Windows 10 ISO file
- Flare-VM
